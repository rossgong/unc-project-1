Project 1: Event API
We are proposing an application for local events to allow users the ability to find events and save them for future reference. We will be focusing on Holidays (Christmas,4th of July, Halloween, etc) and Music (bands, concerts, plays, etc). The user will be able to select the events and save them for future reference. Our site will pull all pertinent event information (time, location, ticket cost) and we will use google maps to assist with venue information (parking, food, hotels). The application will also display band information for the user to link to a bands website if they would like to gather more information about a certain band before attending the event. APIâ€™s we are looking to use include: Eventful, Google Maps, Auth0, Bandsintown and possibly Ticketmaster or Stubhub.
