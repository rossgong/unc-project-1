Project 1: Event API
We are proposing an application for local events to allow users the ability to find events and save them for future reference. We will be focusing on Holidays (Christmas,4th of July, Halloween, etc) and Music (bands, concerts, plays, etc). The user will be able to select the events and save them for future reference. Our site will pull all pertinent event information (time, location, ticket cost) and we will use google maps to assist with venue information (parking, food, hotels). The application will also display band information for the user to link to a bands website if they would like to gather more information about a certain band before attending the event. APIâ€™s we are looking to use include: Eventful, Google Maps, Auth0, Bandsintown and possibly Ticketmaster or Stubhub.

We named our project Events DB and sought to create a simplified application for presenting events on a given day in a simple and clean manner which you could then select and eventually save for future reference.  During this project Ross coded the majority of the Javascript with regards to Eventful, Google Maps and Moment.  Sara and Jerome designed the front end and helped Ross with some of the Javascript.  We ran into some issues with communication between Eventful and Auth0 which we were unable to overcome by the end date regarding authentication and setting up a username/account.  Due to time and simplicity we kept the categories searched to Music, Festivels, Nightlife & Singles, and Performaing Arts.  The appication works well and displays 10 events based on the date and search criteria. We left the application with room to grow into future versions with aspects of: user authorization, link to social media sites, a calendar function, linking travel websites (hotels, car, flights), etc.
